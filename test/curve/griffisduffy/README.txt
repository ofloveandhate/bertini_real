Deflate the Griffis-Duffy platform at a general point of a curve which arises as the intersection of two surfaces.
(In the end, the curve is defined by: e3^2/3 - l*(e3^2 + e4^2) + 3*e4^2 = 0 where l \in C and [e3,e4] \in P^1)


All minors: 588
Codimension many minors: 8
(roughly only 1.36% of the minors are needed to deflate the curve!)

Isosingular deflation was successful!

Number of deflations: 1
Deflation sequence: 4, 1, 1, ...

After deflation, we use Bertini to construct a witness set for this component via monodromy loops:


************** Decomposition by Degree **************

Dimension 1: 1 classified component
-----------------------------------------------------
   degree 3: 1 component
